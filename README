This is a php extension for retriev big configuration.

In some senario, we must store a big configuration, say, maybe 10m.
For such configuration, even using ea/apc will using 10ms to load.
This extension helps to resolve this problem, you can store a serilized
array file in a pre-configed directory. When php-cgi startup, it will
load the serialized file, and store them in the main php-cgi process.
Because of copy-on-write principle both for php and linux process, this
will cost no more memory, and only load once when starting. For usage,
you can use it as just using a array.

Usage:
$abc = btstore_get();
$test = $abc["test"];
